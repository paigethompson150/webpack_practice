## Creating a restaurant page using webpack, npm and ES6 modules.

### Description
A fake restaurant page fully rendered in the DOM using Javascript webpack and ES6 modules. This gave me more practice using npm commands, and importing + exporting functions using modules. My code is pretty spaghetti on this one - I would go back and separate a lot of my functions and modules into multiple individual ones. The background is actually supposed to be a video - but I've been having some trouble with getting my videos to autoplay. (UPDATE: The video is fixed!)
